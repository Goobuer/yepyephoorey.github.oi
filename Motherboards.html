        <h2>Motherboards</h2>
        <p1>
          Motherboards have come a long way from the early days of computing.
          According to Volle (2023), It is considered as the backbone of every
          computer. Each motherboard varies in design, size, and especially
          functionality which are tailored to satisfy or perform specific needs.
          These may include compact systems, complex operations,
          high-performance gaming servers, and many more. Selecting the right
          motherboard for specific applications is very crucial which is
          supported by the study of Paul (2021), thus, discussing these
          different types of motherboards with various comparative studies is
          necessary.

            for today’s PCs.<br />
            = The ATX motherboard replaced it and became super popular because
            it’s easier to use and works better with modern parts. <br />
            = The BTX motherboard was made for better cooling but didn’t catch
            on much. <br />
            = The Extended-ATX (E-ATX) is bigger than ATX and great for
            high-performance computers because it has more room for extra parts.

            cooling and isn’t used anymore.<br />
            = The Micro-ATX motherboard is smaller than ATX but still works with
            modern parts, making it good for budget PCs. <br />
            = The Mini-ITX motherboard is tiny and used for small builds like
            home theater PCs, but it doesn’t have much room for upgrades. <br />

            = The Pico BTX motherboard is super small and good for tight spaces
            but doesn’t have many features. <br />
            = Lastly, the Standard-ATX motherboard is the most common because
            it’s a good size and works well for most PCs. <br />
