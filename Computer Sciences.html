        <h2>Computer Science</h2>
        <p>
          Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems.
          It is a broad field that studies algorithmic processes that make up a
          software and how it interacts with hardware. It is simply a study of
          algorithms which are set to produce an output according to its
          inputted set of instructions (Knuth, 1974).<br /><br />

          It would have been called experimental science, since each new program
          or system developed is an experiment for both hardware and software
          are artifacts that can be opened up and looked inside. Its behaviors,
          may it be solving a problem or being of use to the clients draw many
          insights and lessons from one single experiment. Computers, systems,
          and programs are built to serve as tools for society (Newell and Simon
          2011).<br /><br />

          - Academic discipline concerned with computation itself. <br />
          - Covers theoretical and practical implementation of computation
          architectures. <br />
          - Determines what can or cannot be automated. <br /><br />

            <p1>
              (According to Eden (2007)), <br />
              - (rationalist paradigm) - Amongst them explains that computer
              science is defined as a branch of mathematics as programs and
              systems are mathematical objects. <br />
              - (technocratic paradigm) - Another paradigm explains that
              computer science is an engineering discipline where programs with
              specific data are tested and observed.<br />
              - (scientific paradigm) - The last paradigm explains that with
              computer science branching towards artificial intelligence,
              programs are treated as entities in need of scientific
              experimentation.<br />

            <p1>
              New problem-solving strategies in both virtual and real worlds
              will be envisioned, with the computer sciences making possible
              leaps of innovation and imagination through algorithmic problem
              solving application across diverse academic disciplines.
