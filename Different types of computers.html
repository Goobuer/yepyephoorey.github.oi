        <h2>Different Types of Computers</h2>
        <p>
            Since computers are revolving around an individual's modern life, it is becoming a more and more crucial part of daily tasks. Computers, although in different forms of technologies, are embedded in individualsâ€™ routinary life. Thus, it is important to be aware of aspects and components that make up various types of computers.<br><br>

            Computers vary widely with different types, configurations, forms, and purposes that are tailored to specific needs. These unique features of every type of computer have a role in advancing technology. This comparative analysis will highlight the distinctions or similarities of their capabilities, performance, components, etc. Understanding variations as such, will provide insights that will further contribute in the advancing field of technology (Akinlolu et al., 2020).

          <h3>SUPERCOMPUTERS</h3>
          <div class="more">
            <p1>
                Supercomputers are high-performance systems capable of handling large amounts of data and performing complex computations at remarkable speeds. They employ several processors working in parallel and typically require unique cooling solutions to handle the enormous energy output.

          <h3>MAINFRAME COMPUTERS</h3>
          <div class="more">
            <p1>
                Mainframes are well-known for their ability to efficiently process massive volumes of transactions and data, making them essential for mission-critical activities like financial transactions, payroll, and enterprise resource planning. They provide continuity by providing fault-tolerant systems capable of handling high numbers of concurrent users and transactions (Connect and Extend: Mainframe Modernization Hits Its Stride, 2022).

          <h3>MINI COMPUTERS</h3>
          <div class="more">
            <p1>
                They are intended for uses such as scientific calculations, corporate data management, and industrial control systems. They feature a sturdy design that can accommodate several users with enough memory and processing performance (Wolff, 2021).

          <div class="more">
            <p1>
                From websites to business systems, they form the foundation of today's IT architecture (Andriulo et al., 2024). Scalability and dependability are key considerations while designing servers. Heavy workloads typically require numerous cores, significant quantities of memory, backup power sources, and robust cooling systems.
